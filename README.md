# Yearly Theme Prompts for ChatGPT

---

At the start of each year, my family and I each pick a "yearly theme" instead of new year's resolutions. The yearly theme acts as a guiding principle to help direct our energy, activities, and decisions throughout the year. The idea of a yearly theme was inspired by [The Cortex podcast](https://www.relay.fm/cortex) and their excellent [Theme System](https://www.themesystem.com/) notebook.

However, [naming things is really hard](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TwoHardThings.html). If you are anything like me, I start with a long list of aspirations and [leitmotifs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itMJ-fUPXqE) for the upcoming year but then have trouble distilling it down into a simple word or phrase. I'll be referring to this name for an entire year so I want it to be a good balance of specific, inspirational, and memorable. The goal is to be able to refer to it simply as **The Year of \[\[...\]\]**.

When choosing the names for our 2024 themes, we discovered that ChatGPT is an excellent brainstorm partner. Here I share the prompts that we used to generate the words, mission statement, and images that represent our yearly themes. A few friends have already tested the prompts out and reported back good results. This will also be a useful reference for generating themes for future years!

For all of the below prompts, we got good output using ChatGPT4. 


# Name for the Yearly Theme

> I'm coming up with a yearly theme. Yeary themes are a way to guide and focus the coming year in a way that helps me improve or make positive change. Themes are more like a guiding spirit of the year that helps guide all sorts of actions, as opposed to setting a single goal. 
> 
> For my yearly themes, I like to pick a single word or short phrase that is resonant with the themes that I'm focused on. The word/phrase should serve as a shorthand or quick reminder that sort of immediately puts me in the right mindset. 
> 
> I'm going to explain to you the themes I want for this year and you will me come up with a name for the theme. Bias toward powerful, single word names. But you can also propose short, resonant phrases. Does that make sense?

<i>... \[System response\] ...</i>

> This year's theme is focused on [[theme description]].
> 
> Here are the areas I'm focused on, with a single word that describes the trait I want:
> - [[Trait or Goal]]. [[Description of trait or goal that you want to embody this year.]]
> - ...
> - ...

# Mission Statement

Continued in the same chat thread...

> I'll call this year "The Year of [[YOUR_THEME_NAME]]". Can you write a punchy, resonant mission statement for the year? It should be a 1 sentence mantra that digs one level deeper than the theme name. Give me a few ideas. 

Additional refining prompts if needed:

> I like [[positive aspects]] but we don't need to say [[negative aspects]]. Can you also make it a little less flowering and more like a personal mission statement?

... or ...

> I want to emphasize [[concept one]] and [[concept two]]. Can you create a new mission statement based on those concepts?

# Theme Concept Image

Continued in the same chat thread...

> Can you create an image that captures the spirit and goals of The Year of [[theme]]? Keep the image simple and elegant, and use [[concepts that you want to showcase]].
