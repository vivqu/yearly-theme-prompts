For all of the below prompts, we got good output using ChatGPT4. 


# Prompt: Yearly Theme Name

To brainstorm naming, we utilized role and dual prompting approaches to provide more detailed instruction and higher quality output.

> I'm coming up with a yearly theme. Yeary themes are a way to guide and focus the coming year in a way that helps me improve or make positive change. Themes are more like a guiding spirit of the year that helps guide all sorts of actions, as opposed to setting a single goal. 
> 
> For my yearly themes, I like to pick a single word or short phrase that is resonant with the themes that I'm focused on. The word/phrase should serve as a shorthand or quick reminder that sort of immediately puts me in the right mindset. 
> 
> I'm going to explain to you the themes I want for this year and you will me come up with a name for the theme. Bias toward powerful, single word names. But you can also propose short, resonant phrases. Does that make sense?

<i>... \[System response\] ...</i>

> This year's theme is focused on [[theme description]].
> 
> Here are the areas I'm focused on, with a single word that describes the trait I want:
> - [[Trait or Goal]]. [[Description of trait or goal that you want to embody this year.]]
> - ...
> - ...

You can also incorporate few shot examples to improve the output. Here is a sample of the output generated for my 2024 yearly themes, which I thought was quite impressive:

> Based on the themes and traits you've outlined for the year, it's clear you're aiming for a balance between joyful engagement in your hobbies and interests, a multi-faceted approach to life that avoids overemphasis on pressure or rigid schedules, a bountiful output in your personal projects, and a focus on being present and mindful in your daily life. Here are some potential names for your yearly theme that encapsulate these ideas:
> 1. **Flourish**: This word captures the idea of thriving in various aspects of your life, from hobbies to personal projects, all while maintaining a sense of joy and presence.
> 2. **Harvest**: Reflecting the idea of reaping the rewards of your long-held ideas and projects, while also implying a sense of abundance and fulfillment.
> 3. **Bloom**: Suggesting growth and development in a natural, joyous way, aligning with your focus on hobbies, fitness, and being present in the moment.
> 4. **Kaleidoscope**: Symbolizing the variety and multifaceted nature of your interests and pursuits, while also suggesting a sense of wonder and joy.


# Prompt: Mission Statement

Continued in the same chat thread...

> I'll call this year "The Year of [[YOUR_THEME_NAME]]". Can you write a punchy, resonant mission statement for the year? It should be a 1 sentence mantra that digs one level deeper than the theme name. Give me a few ideas. 

Additional refining prompts if needed:

> I like [[positive aspects]] but we don't need to say [[negative aspects]]. Can you also make it a little less flowering and more like a personal mission statement?

... or ...

> I want to emphasize [[concept one]] and [[concept two]]. Can you create a new mission statement based on those concepts?

# Prompt: Theme Concept Image

Continued in the same chat thread...

> Can you create an image that captures the spirit and goals of The Year of [[theme]]? Keep the image simple and elegant, and use [[concepts that you want to showcase]].

Some examples of visual styles that have worked for our concept images:
- impressionist style with pastel color palette
- flat, vector-style drawing using only 3 or 4 colors
- Ghibli movie, rendered with gouache paint
