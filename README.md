# Prompts to Pick a Yearly Theme

---

My family and I each pick a "yearly theme" at the beginning of the year in lieu of new year's resolutions. It acts as a guiding principle to help direct our energy, activities, and decisions throughout the year. The idea of a yearly theme was inspired by [The Cortex podcast](https://www.relay.fm/cortex) and their excellent [Theme System](https://www.themesystem.com/) notebook.

However, [naming things is really hard](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TwoHardThings.html). If you're similar to me, I start with a long list of aspirations and [leitmotifs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itMJ-fUPXqE) for the upcoming year. It can be a huge struggle to distill down all of the concepts into a single theme that captures it all. I want to ultimately write that this year is the "Year of \[SUCCINCT_PERFECT_WORD\]".

For naming our 2024 themes, we discovered that ChatGPT is an excellent brainstorm partner. Here I share the prompts that we used to generate the words, mission statement, and images that represent our yearly themes. A few friends have already tested the prompts out for themselves and reported back good results. This will also be a useful prompt reference for us for future years!

# Brainstorm a Theme Names

> I'm coming up with a yearly theme. Yeary themes are a way to guide and focus the coming year in a way that helps me improve or make positive change. Themes are more like a guiding spirit of the year that helps guide all sorts of actions, as opposed to setting a single goal. 

For my yearly themes, I like to pick a single word or short phrase that is resonant with the themes that I'm focused on. The word/phrase should serve as a shorthand or quick reminder that sort of immediately puts me in the right mindset. 

I'm going to explain to you the themes I want for this year and you will me come up with a name for the theme. Bias toward powerful, single word names. But you can also propose short, resonant phrases. Does that make sense?
